<!--This tells your browser which version of html you're using, to stay up to
date with current html, just put the following code below, this is necessary-->
<!DOCTYPE html>

<!-- This element helps search engines and other developers find the main
content of your page!, this would be at the start and end of the main content-->
<main>
<!-- Main Content -->

<!-- As you can see, these are header titles which are bigger than regualr text,
h1 being the biggest and h6 being the smallest -->
<h1> Ahem, I'm the biggest amongst all of u haha</h1>
<h2>I wouldn't say that if I were you</h2>
<h3>Look who's talking haha</h3>
<h4>Get Rekt both of you I'm bigger!</h4>
<h5> ha! I'm bigger</h5>
<h6>I'm small :(, but a little big :D</h6>

<!-- Here's how it would look with the correlation of header tags and paragraph
tags!-->

  <p>HTML is the skeletal structure of a website :D</p>

<!--This is a <p> tag, this signifies making a paragraph of some sorts-->
<p>Hello!</p>

it's also a way to make code inactive but you don't want to delete it! -->

<!--This is the type of code needed to put in an image!, use the <img> tag and
within it, there is src standing for source, this is where you put the link
address of the image, alt would be the text that is shown if the image is
no longer available-->

<!-- This is an anchor element, it links and element to another website/page,
so if you were to click on the underlined word/phrase/etc.
it would redirect you to somewhere else, it uses the attribute "href" followed
by the link you want person to be directed to if they click it -->
<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/"> Click here to learn how to code!
</a>

<!-- You can also make anchor elements that'll link to internal sections of your
website! For example, if you have a long page/website about a research paper
having multiple sections, you can have an anchor element at the top for that
person to click to be directed to the summary, to make this it would be the same
as linking to an external website/page but the "href" attribute would equal
"id" of the element where you want the person to be directed to using a # before
the name of the id -->
<a href="#summary">Summary</a>
...
<h2 id="summary">Summary</a>

<!-- You can nest an Anchor Element within a paragraph! Some key things to know
is that the "target" is an attribute that specifies where to open the link with
the value "_blank specifying to open it in a new tab". Here's is an example -->
<p>
  Here's a link to my own personal <a target="_blank"
  href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/benson-manzano-380a451b7/">
  LinkedIn!</a> Hope you enjoy!
</p>

<!-- You can make dead links using the hashtag symbol, this means it would be
linked but it wouldn't take you anywhere, this will come in handy when using
Javascript -->
<a target="_blank" href="#">This is a dead link</a>

<!-- You can also turn an image into a link! Meaning if they clicked on the
image they would be redirected to another website/page! This is done by nesting
the "img" within the anchor("a") element, below is an example with a dead link-->
<a target="_blank" href="#"><img src="https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=http%3A%2F%2Frebloggy.com%2Fpost%2Fadventure-time-bmo-dancing-gif-happy-gif%2F61901932983&psig=AOvVaw1gIIiJk9M3SFMUaCb9Tuzi&ust=1609782263828000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCIiA67KogO4CFQAAAAAdAAAAABAK"

<!--You can make a Bulleted Unordered List meaning a list but in bullet point
style you would use the "<ul>" element signifiying it as an unordered list and
the "<li>" element as the listing, remember to add slashes to singnify it ends!
-->
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>Python</li>
  <li>Javascript</li>
</ul>

<!-- You can also make an ordered list meaning it's with numbers, it's basically
like the coding above with the unordered list but you're using the element "<ol>"
to signify an ordered list! -->
<ol>
  <li>Bananas</li>
  <li>Strawberries</li>
  <li>Kiwis</li>
  <li>Watermelon</li>
</ol>

<!-- This section is in regards of making a form -->

<!-- You can make a Web Form! Let's start off with how to make a text field.
The input element is a convenient way to get input from your user! There's
certain types of input so you would use the "type" attribute and give it the
value "text", it's also a self closing tab like "img" -->
<input type="text">

<!-- You can put placeholder text in our text field! For example, whenever you
need to log in into something and you see password and username in the boxes,
that is placeholder text! To do this we're just adding the placeholder attribute
and giving it the value of what we want as the placeholder -->
<input type="text" placeholder=" this is placeholder text">

<!-- If you want data to actually be submitted to a server than using html then
the "<form>" element will you your friend. The form element should have the
action attribute and that value would be the server you want to submit the data
to, you would also nest your input element within the form element like this -->
<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data">
  <input type="text" placeholder=" this is placeholder text">
</form>

<!-- Let's make a submit button, by clicking this button it will send data from
the form to the specified URL in the form's action attribute, this would be
nested in the form element, with the element "<button>" and the attribute "type"
equaling "submit", then add the text and closing tag, below is an example with
the submit button nested into the form element -->
<form action="/url-where-you-want-to-submit-form-data">
  <input type="text" placeholder=" this is placeholder text">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

<!-- Want to make a field of input required, meaning the user is required to
input information into specific form fields, you can simply put required in your
input element, this will make it required! -->
<input type="text" placeholder="Password" required>

<!-- There different types of input you can use, one of these are by using Radio
buttons where the user will only be able to select one answer out of multiple
options, kind of like in a multiple choice test. Radio buttons are a type of
input, each input element being one option would be nested in a label element,
this is so that it will automatically associate the radio buttion input with the
label element surrounding it. Related radio buttons should have the same name
attribute to create a radio button group. This enjures that only one option gets
picked. It's considered best practice to set a for attribute on the label element
with a value that matches the id of the input element. -->
<label for="dogs">
  <input id="dogs" type="radio" name="animals">dogs
</label>
<label for="cats">
  <input id="cats" type="radio" name="animals">cats
</label>
<label for="rock">
  <input id="rock" type="radio" name="animals">Patrick's Rocky
</label>

<!-- Checkboxes is another type of input you can use. These can be nested in
their own label element and by doing this it will automatically associate the
checkbox input with the label element surrounding it. It's also good practice to
set the for attribute on the label element as the same as the id of the input,
the steps are completely the same as coding the radio type of input but instead
it's checkboxes allowing you to select more than one! -->
<label for="hamburger">
  <input id="hamburger" type="checkbox" name="food">hamburger
</label>
<label for="hotdog">
  <input id="hotdog" type="checkbox" name="food">hotdog
</label>
<label for="pizza">
  <input id="pizza" type="checkbox" name="food">pizza
</label>

<!-- When the form is submitted, the data is sent to the specified server, the
inputs of are reported by the value attribute, if you don't iuse the value
attribute, the sever will either recieve the data as on or off which isn't
helpful, so it's important to add a value to the value atrribute! -->
<label for="pc">
  <input id="pc" value="pc" type="radio" name="gaming">PC
</label>
<label for="mobile">
  <input id="mobile" value="mobile" type="radio" name="gaming">Mobile
</label>
<label for="console">
  <input id="console" value="console" type="radio" name="gaming">Console
</label>

<!-- With forms, you can set things automatically checked by adding the checked
attribute within the input element -->
<label for="icecream">
  <input id="icecream" value="icecream" type="radio" name="cold" checked>icecream
</label>

<!-- End of form -->

<!-- The <div> element is known as the division element which is a general
purpose container for other elements-->
<div>
  <h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2>
    <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
      tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.

<!-- Organization of your code is important! You can organize your code by using
specific tags like <html>, <head>, <body>, <footer>, <main>, and many others -->
<!DOCTYPE hmtl>

  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- page contents -->
